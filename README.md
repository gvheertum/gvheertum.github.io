### \<summary \/\> | About me
I'm Gertjan, I'm 34 and live in Oss with my wife and daughter. I’m a Software Engineer who likes to consider the bigger picture. In my career in the IT industry I’ve seen lots of application-domains and covered almost every activity involved in inventing, designing, creating and supporting software.

Recently I’ve has grown into a more strategic role where I was responsible for the ISO 27001:2017 certification (Information Security Management System) and setting up of the Quality Assurance and Quality Control workflows within the company. Together with our development team I also setup our support desk and knowledge bases to embed knowledge sharing in our team and with customers. 

I love being a mentor for other developers and stakeholders in software projects. I like to assist colleagues with technical questions but am also not afraid to work with clients and end-users to be able to work towards the best possible solution. Combined with periodic reviews on code and process I try to get everybody to the next level.

### \<option \/\> | Exploring for job options
I’m looking for a role that allows me to combine security, operational, strategy and development. In my current role I setup the ISMS for the ISO 27001 certification and am combining this with IT QA activities. I would love to find a new opportunity which will give me the same challenge and satisfaction as my current role. 

Looking for jobs on a 24 to 32 hours basis since I would like to keep work and family balanced.
