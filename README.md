### \<summary /\> | About me
I'm Gertjan, I'm 35 and live in Oss with my wife and daughter. I’m a Software Engineer who likes to consider the bigger picture. In my career in the IT industry I’ve seen lots of application-domains and covered almost every activity involved in inventing, designing, creating and supporting software.

I love being a mentor for other developers and stakeholders in software projects. I like to assist colleagues with technical questions but am also not afraid to work with clients and end-users to be able to work towards the best possible solution. Combined with periodic reviews on code and process I try to get everybody to the next level.
